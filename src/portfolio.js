It allows users to log in with multiple Google accounts, visualize and manage their storage, and seamlessly transfer files between source and destination drives. Built using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, the system includes intelligent features like file type segregation, deletion options post-transfer, and destination folder selection. A standout capability is the face recognition-based photo tagging and search, which automatically labels known individuals in images and enables quick retrieval by name. This project blends cloud APIs, AI-based face recognition, and user-friendly UI design to create an efficient and intuitive file management experience tailored especially for users juggling multiple Drive accounts.",
